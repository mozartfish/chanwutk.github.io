  I am a Master Student in the Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science and
  Engineering at the University of Washington. I work as a research
  assistant in the
  <a href="https://idl.cs.washington.edu/">UW Interactive Data Lab</a>. I am
  interested in Data Visualization and Data Systems. My research explore
  efficient methods to layout labels (annotations) of data points in charts.
  I contribute to existing research projects including
  <a href="https://vega.github.io/vega/">Vega</a> and
  <a href="https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/">Vega-Lite</a>. Concurrently, I
  also work as a teaching assistant for Computer Science classes at the
  University of Washington.

  I graduated with Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from the
  University of Washington in 2020. I have worked in DocuSign and OctoML
  during summers as a Software Engineering Intern. Aside from academic
  works, I was a volunteered officer of
  <a href="https://www.facebook.com/thaisauw/">Thai Students Association</a
  >, coordinating social events and meetups for Thai students in the
  University of Washington.
