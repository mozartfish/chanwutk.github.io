      I am a Master Student in the Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science and
      Engineering at the University of Washington. I work as a research
      assistant in the
      <a href="https://idl.cs.washington.edu/">UW Interactive Data Lab</a>. I am
      interested in Data Visualization and Machine Learning. My research explore
      efficient methods to layout labels (annotations) of data points in charts.
      I contribute to existing research projects including
      <a href="https://vega.github.io/vega/">Vega</a> and
      <a href="https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/">Vega-Lite</a>. Concurrently, I
      also work as a teaching assistant for Computer Science classes at the
      University of Washington.

      I graduated with Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from the
      University of Washington in 2020. I have worked in DocuSign and OctoML
      during summers as a Software Engineering Intern. Aside from academic
      works, I was a volunteered officer of
      <a hred="https://www.facebook.com/thaisauw/">Thai Students Association</a
      >, coordinating social events and meetups for Thai students in the
      University of Washington.
