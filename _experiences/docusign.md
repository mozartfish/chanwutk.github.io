  Contributing to designing and developing a platform that extracts, sanitizes, and stores users'/internal
  usage data as a data lake into Amazon Web Service. Then, Data Scientist can query the data to perform analytics.
---
The system is developed with python and spark. My contribution includes two mainworks:
(1) design AWS lambda to auto-shutdown idle EMR clusters and notebooks to prevent unnecessary cost of stoped but not terminated services.
(2) design a spark job to keep the schema of the serviceâ€™s database up-to-date and to clean up unused files from failed data ingestion to prevent dirty data from being analyzed
